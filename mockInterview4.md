What I have learned from this mock interview is be confident. If you dont't know the exact answer they are looking for then describe subjects/topics/examples that pertain to   
the topic they are asking the question about. When they ask a question about a topic you are very familiar with, then it is your time to shine and elaborate with much detail  
on the topic they are asking a question about.
